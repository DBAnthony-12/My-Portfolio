      <h1><u>About Me</u></h1> 

    <p>
      Ever since I was child, I had a passion for computers as I went to
      computer labs in primary school and do fun activities on the computer and
      I found interest in computers. <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      As I grew up, I still had a passion for computers even though I stopped
      going to the computer labs but rather have my own computer at home to do
      school work and other fun activities during my free time. I also had a
      play laptop which I enjoyed playing on and learning new things on the
      laptop which the laptop was huge benefit for me because it helped in my
      school work and my passion for computers just grew even more. <br />

      At first, I did not know what I wanted to study. My first option was to
      study in the medical field and then I changed my mind to study IT which is
      why I took CAT as one of my subjects in high school as computers is my
      passion. The course I studied is Software Development at Rosebank college.
      I started studying in 2021 and finished in November 2023. At first I found
      this course challenging as I did not have any background experiences on
      coding but in my second year of studies, I found the course not so bad as
      I thought it would be. I actually started liking the software development
      course and my aim is to build on more knowledge and learn new Languages as
      time goes on. My next aim is to get into a software development company so
      that I can start my career journey as a software developer. My dream is to
      become a successful hard working person to achieve my goals in life that I
      have set out for myself.
